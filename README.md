The code we have so far has been generated with a chat-GPT prompt (prompt.txt)
The goal is to create a wordpress plugin to communicate with the X api to create, delete, and retrieve tweets and have a functional GUI experience.

This is a team-project with Joash Muganda, Suresh Sharma, and Alexis Ambriz. 
It is currently a work-in-progress~!
